While I was growing up my father played a huge rule in the development of my personality and way of thinking.
Being a physicist, he thaught me how to love nature, how to observe it and how to interprete it.
At school, solving mathematical and physics problems was a great pleasure for me.
Later on, I found my way through the art of programming and the joy of using reason to answer simple problems.
However, I've always kept the love for physics close to my heart. Even to the day, I enjoy thinking about the microscopic world and the peculiar rules that govern it.
My dream is to understand them, exploit them, and teach them. 

I found that by studying Quantum Computing, for my final year project as well as for leisure, it became easier for me to
answer some of my questions. More than that, new questions arose whose answers I seek to learn.
By following various mathematical courses in university, during which I learned and loved linear algebra, I believe I was provided with the necessary skills
to further explore the area, understand its mathematics, solve problems 


Getting to do a PhD at Imperial College will be a great pleaseure and privilledge for me. I view it as an opportunity to share my idea and receive
comments and input on them from the great minds. This will allow me to quickly discard them, or adapt them to new information learned. Also, on my behalf,
I would like to share what I learn during mu studies. I hope that my work will influence and intrigue other members of the community. Not only that
but 


Pursuing a PhD, I will not not only seek to understand Quantum Computing but most importantly to find a simple and elegant way to convey this knowledge.

Richard Feynman once said knowing something and knowing its name are two different things.
When it comes to nature, I don't want to know just its name. I want to learn how it works, why it works and how else could it work.
With multiple discoveries taking place on how to manipulate elementary particles, I believe our world is not far from seeing a universal quantum computer being realised.
I want to be there. I want to be ready to use it.
